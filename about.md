<p> Grad Student at Texas A&M University, trying to figure out what to do with my life.<br>
To keep myself occupied, I take courses from the <a href="http://engineering.tamu.edu/cse.html">TAMU CSE department</a>. As part of <a href="http://courses.cse.tamu.edu/caverlee/csce670/">CSCE670: Inforrmation Retrieval</a>, I had to create a webpage for a random search query and get it indexed by Google, 
here's my <a href="/kbeznak-parmatonic.html">attempt to make "kbeznak-parmatonic" a thing!</a>.<br>
And my <a href="/comps-newMedia">webpage</a> for <a href="http://www.csdl.tamu.edu/~shipman/courses/cnm/home.html">CSCE656: Computers and New Media</a>
