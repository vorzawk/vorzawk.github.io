<p> Grad Student in the <a href="http://engineering.tamu.edu/cse.html">TAMU CSE department</a>, trying to figure out what to do with my life.<br><br>
As part of <a href="http://courses.cse.tamu.edu/caverlee/csce670/">CSCE670: Information Retrieval</a>, I had to create a webpage for a term which has never been seen before and get the webpage indexed by Google. My approach is to make an awesome webpage for <a href="/kbeznak-parmatonic.html">"kbeznak-parmatonic"</a>, so that Google will be forced to index because of the user traffic on the page.<br>
