<p> I have completed my Masters degree in Computer Science from <a href="https://www.tamu.edu/">Texas A&M University</a>, under the guidance of <a
href="http://faculty.cse.tamu.edu/ajiang/">Dr. Anxiao Jiang</a>. As part of my Masters Thesis, we focused on the threat where the parameters of a deep learning model are
maliciously modified. We demonstrated that small modifications to the model parameters are enough to compromise the model without significantly
affecting its performance, which means that such an attack would be hard to detect. We also studied the characteristics of our attack strategy and devised a strategy for detecting the attack. You can
find a complete discussion of our work in my thesis, which can be accessed <a href="/thesis.pdf">here</a>.
<br><br>
I am passionate about technology, with a love for solving problems and learning how things work. I am looking for a job opportunity that will allow me to do these while working with an enthusiastic team.<br><br>
