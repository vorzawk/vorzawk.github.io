<p> I have completed my Masters degree in Computer Science from <a href="https://www.tamu.edu/">Texas A&M University</a>, under <a
href="http://faculty.cse.tamu.edu/ajiang/">Dr. Anxiao Jiang</a>. We focused on the threat where the parameters of a deep learning model are
maliciously modified. We demonstrated that small modifications to the model parameters are enough to compromise the model without significantly
affecting its performance. We also studied the characteristics of our attack strategy and devised a strategy to detect the attack. You can
find a complete discussion of our work in my thesis, which can be accessed <a href="/thesis.pdf">here</a>.

I love solving problems and learning how things work. I am looking for a job opportunity that will allow me to do these while working on the latest technologies with an enthusiastic team.<br><br>
