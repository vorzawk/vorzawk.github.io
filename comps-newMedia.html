  <p> There was a time when smartphones weren't available, people had to find a computer to browse the internet.
This wasn't exactly convenient, so going to the library to read a book was still a thing!
I am talking about the year 2007, ~10 years ago.
In this short period of time, smart phones have become ubiquitous and all the information in the world is at our finger tips.
At first glance, this might seem like a great thing but I am not so sure.
I think the new media is very powerful and care must be taken to ensure that it is used the right way.</p>
  <br>
  <p> The media I use are my laptop and phone, pretty much the same stuff on both devices.<br>
