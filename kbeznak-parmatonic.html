  <h1>kbeznak parmatonic</h1>
  <p><b>kbeznak parmatonic</b> is a new word coined by <a href="http://faculty.cse.tamu.edu/caverlee/">Dr.Caverlee</a> for a <b>SEO</b>(Search Engine Optimization) Contest as part of <a href="http://courses.cse.tamu.edu/caverlee/csce670/index.html">CS670:Information Retrieval</a>.</p>
  <h3>Hold on! What does SEO even mean?</h3>
  <p>Let's take a step back and think about how we got here.<br>
  If you're like most people, you probably "googled" for kbeznak parmatonic and followed one of the first few links. Turns out this is true for not just this page but webpages in general, <a href="https://www.imforza.com/blog/8-seo-stats-that-are-hard-to-ignore/">93% of onine experiences begin with the search engine</a>.</p>
  <p>Due to the amount of information on the web, search engines like Google act as gatekeepers connecting the users to the information they seek. It gets even more interesting, a 2013 <a href="https://searchenginewatch.com/sew/study/2276184/no-1-position-in-google-gets-33-of-search-traffic-study">study</a> reports that 33% of the users click the first link in the search results and 95% never look past the first page!</p>
  <p>Think about the consequences of this, let's consider an upcoming business, for example. The search engine ranking can be the difference between the company reaching customers and sinking into obvilion. SEO refers to strategies to make sure that the company website ranks high in the results page and stays there.</p>
  <p>At this point you may be wondering, all this is great to start a company but how is this applicable in CSCE 670. And perhaps more importantly, where does kbeznak parmatonic figure into all of this? To answer these, we'll have to dig deeper!</p>
  <p>One of the goals of this course is to learn about how search engines find and return the relevant information among the billions of web pages on the Internet. And this needs to be done really fast coz <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGxwbhkDjZM">ain't nobody got time for dat</a>, right?<br>
  Dr.Caverlee's genius insight was that by attempting to propel our web page for a hitherto unseen term a.k.a kbeznak parmatonic to the top of the search list, we'll understand more about how Google decides what is relevant to the search query and what is not.</p>
  <p>Google uses a number of techniques to ensure that only the most relevant results appear at the top, one important idea is PageRank which tries to estimate how good a webpage is by looking at the webpages which link to it. However, just looking at the pages which link to the web page is not enough and Google does a lot more behind the scenes to ensure thwart people trying to game the system. The end goal is to ensure that users find high quality content at the top of the search list.</p>

  <p>So far, many attempts have been made to try and paint kbeznak parmatonic as a <a href="http://people.tamu.edu/~pura247/">grave problem for America</a> or as a <a href="http://www.kbeznakparmatonic.org/">company</a> or even as a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kbeznak-parmatonic-1a4ab113b/">Graduate Student at Texas A&M University</a>. But this is not the approach I am taking though, I believe that providing useful and high quality content is a better approach. Besides, I am terrible at cooking up my own stories and try to make one for kbeznak parmatonic seems like a bad idea!</p>

  <p>For now, that's everything you need to know about kbeznak parmatonic. Stay tuned for more!</p>
