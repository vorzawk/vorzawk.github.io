  <h2> Common themes and interests </h2>
  <p> Looking through the webpages of my classmates, there are some unique aspects to everybody but there are also some glaring commonalities. As far as reasons for taking the course are concerned, there basically two different goals:
  <ul>
    <li><b>Learning how to use the new media to create new UI applications</b></li>
    Even though the goal of creating new UI apps is shared, the purposes are varied. For eg, <a href="http://people.tamu.edu/~doddapanenipc/">Purna</a> wants to use the new media to enhance video games and <a href="http://students.cse.tamu.edu/nishant.barma/">Nishant</a> wants to enhance teaching in schools. There are others who are interested in HCI and web development, for them this course offers a new perspective to deepen their knowledge.
    <li><b>To know how the new media affects us</b></li>
    In the last decade or so, the computers and the Internet have changed the world. All the information in the world is literally at our finger tips due to the advent of smart phones. Things have changed so much and it has all happened so fast, it'd be naive to claim that this level of technological progress has no negative impact! It looks like many of my classmates share my interest in learning about new media. <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/cpsc656samiakabir/">Samia</a>, <a href="http://students.cse.tamu.edu/jacobfenger/656/">Jacob</a>, <a href="http://people.tamu.edu/~nitishchandra/">Nitish</a> and others have expressed their interest in learning more about how the new media is affecting our lives.
  </ul>

  <p>Looking at the interests, almost everybody in the class uses social media, plays games, watches TV and listens to music. Most of the media consumption happens through phones or laptops rather than physical media like newspapers or print books.</p>
