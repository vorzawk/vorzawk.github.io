<h1>Hi there, I'm Abhilash!</h1>
<p>I'm an computer programmer and student at <a href="https://www.tamu.edu/">Texas A&M University</a>. 
<br>
I love meeting new people. 
So, if I spot someone who doesn't seem busy, I immediately go over and introduce myself.
I have had some really interesting conversations and some awkward silences as well, either way I learn a lot by simply saying "Hi" whenever I get the chance!
<br><a href="/about">Read more about my life...</a>
<br><br>
<b>Words to live by:</b> <br>
The time we have on this rock is precious, might as well spend it on learning new things and doing stuff!<br>
Don't worry about making mistakes because you learn a lot more from your mistakes than your successes!  <br>
Everyone you meet has something valuable to teach you.
</p>
