<h1>Hi there, I'm Abhilash!</h1>
<p>I'm an computer programmer and student at <a href="https://www.tamu.edu/">Texas A&M University</a>. 
<br><br>
I love meeting new people and will try to strike up a conversation whenever I see an opportunity.
I have had some really interesting conversations and some awkward silences, I learn a lot by simply saying "Hi" whenever I get the chance!
<br><br>
<b>Words to live by:</b> <br>
<ul>
<li>The time we have on this rock is precious, might as well spend it on learning new things and doing stuff!</li>
<li>Don't worry about making mistakes because you learn a lot more from your mistakes than your successes!</li> 
<li>Everyone you meet has something valuable to teach you.</li>
</ul>
</p>
