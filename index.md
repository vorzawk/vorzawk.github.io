<h1>Hi there, I'm Abhilash!</h1>
<p>I'm an avid reader and computer programmer. I love talking to people, so feel free to <a href="mailto:vrabhilash@tamu.edu">contact</a> me!
<br>
I am constantly on the look out for new things to learn and improve. The time we have on this rock is precious, might as well spend it on learning new things and doing stuff!
<br><br>
Don't worry about making mistakes because you learn a lot more from your mistakes than your successes!
